I've taken this code directly from Joe Meenen's tutorial "A Complete Game Made with Corona SDK".  Thanks for the great game walkthrough, Joe.

I'm posting it here to dabble with and let others access it easily.  I'm just learning Corona and want to experiment with this.  I've got some goals in mind such as:

* Multi-user support with saved profiles
* Implement SQLite for storing profiles
* Different Graphics for "Food" and "Freddy"
* User can import photos for "Food" and "Freddy" and select as desired
